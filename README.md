Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major complication of diabetes, recognized as the leading cause of blindness among adults of working age globally. It results from prolonged high blood glucose levels that damage the small blood vessels in the retina, leading to fluid leakage and the growth of abnormal blood vessels. Without timely detection and intervention, DR can progress to severe vision loss or complete blindness.

The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 463 million people worldwide have diabetes, with nearly one-third expected to develop some form of DR. The standard method for detecting DR involves a dilated eye exam, which is time-consuming and requires trained ophthalmologists. Given the global scale of diabetes and the resource-intensive nature of current detection methods, there is a critical need for automated, accurate, and efficient screening tools.

In this study, we explore the use of deep learning models for the automated detection of diabetic retinopathy. Specifically, we conduct a comparative analysis of two widely used convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: VGG-19 and ResNet-50. The models were trained and evaluated using the APTOS dataset, which contains 4,997 retinal images categorized into five stages of DR: No DR, Mild DR, Moderate DR, Severe DR, and Proliferative DR.

Our results demonstrate that the ResNet-50 model achieved an accuracy of 99% with a loss of 0.02, outperforming the VGG-19 model, which attained an accuracy of 97% and a loss of 0.05. This study highlights the potential of deep learning models in improving the efficiency and accuracy of DR detection, providing a scalable solution that could significantly enhance early diagnosis and treatment, ultimately improving patient outcomes on a global scale.
